This scene shows the mixture of different heightmap "Resolutions" & "Smoothing Iterations" for terrain surfaces to get started about
optimal performance in scene.

Take a look at the terrain objects info billboards in the hierarchy to compare between their "Resolutions" & "Smoothing Iterations".

The goal is to show users how they can avoid extra pixels in data and finally reduce the performance cost by setting the proper
heightmap resolution value in the first original terrain generation step.

Note: These terrains were originally downloaded & generated by "TerraLand Downloader". The unwanted stairing steps and terrace shapes
on surface is because the original data from ESRI is resampled to the user-input value (e.g. 1024) in TerraLand and due to upsampling
where new pixels were generated, these artifacts will normally occur.
