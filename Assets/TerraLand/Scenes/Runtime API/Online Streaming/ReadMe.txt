TerraLand WorldExplorer - Travel the whole Earth in Real-Time


TerraLand's Run-Time features gives you the ability to travel from a starting point on Earth to any desired location whether it's just
a few meters away or thousands of kilometers.

Player can travel to any place while terrains will be generated around the player dynamically and everything in the scene is going to
be generated procedurally during the gameplay.

ESRI servers feed Elevation & Satellite Imagery into the Run-Time Engine and TerraLand converts data into 3D on the fly.

Designed for realtime rendering of generating worlds as the system is so flexible to adjust for various quality & performance settings
which can be set up for any target platform including mobiles by adjusting different parameters of heightmap & imagery resolution,
concurrent tasks, operation delays and etc.
